# üè• Doctor & Lab Appointment Booking System

A full-stack **Doctor & Lab Appointment Booking System** built with **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, **JWT**, **JavaScript**, and **MySQL**. The application enables patients to search and book appointments with doctors and labs, while administrators can manage users, appointments, and services through a secure and role-based system.

## üß± Architecture & Best Practices

This project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Don't-Repeat YOurself (DRY)** and adheres to **SOLID Principles** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns.
### ‚úÖ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Separation between business logic, application flow, and infrastructure
- Each domain entity models real-world concepts (e.g., Doctor, Appointment)

### ‚úÖ SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class or component has one responsibility  
- **O**pen/Closed: System is open for extension, closed for modification  
- **L**iskov Substitution: Replace base classes with subclasses without issues  
- **I**nterface Segregation: Fine-grained interfaces for clear contracts  
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concrete classes

### ‚úÖ Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Instead of duplicating time slot checks in multiple controllers or services, create a reusable TimeSlotValidator service to  validate overlapping appointments or availability
- Use centralized mapper classes (e.g., AppointmentMapper, DoctorMapper) to convert between entities and DTOs, avoiding repeated mapping logic across controllers
- Store all endpoint paths in a centralized ApiPaths class to prevent hardcoding URLs in multiple places
- Handle repeated error cases (e.g., not found, invalid input) using a global @ControllerAdvice instead of repeating try-catch blocks
- Move input validation (e.g., for doctor registration, appointment booking) into a reusable ValidationService instead of embedding it directly in controllers
- Centralize JWT extraction and role verification logic in a utility class or filter, rather than repeating it in each secured endpoint
- Use a standard response wrapper (e.g., ApiResponse<T>) for success/error responses across all controllers to avoid redundant formatting
